# Shape Visualization Update Guide

## Overview

All visualizers have been updated to display **actual shapes** (Rectangles, Circles, Triangles) with **price information** and **proper rotation handling**.

---

## What Changed

### 1. **Java Optimizer - JSON Output Enhanced**

The JSON output now includes `shape` and `price` fields for each item:

```json
{
  "binId": 1,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "A_Rectangle01_0",
      "shape": "Rectangle",
      "x": 0,
      "y": 0,
      "width": 10,
      "height": 3,
      "price": 10.0
    },
    {
      "id": "C_Circle_0",
      "shape": "Circle",
      "x": 10,
      "y": 0,
      "width": 5,
      "height": 5,
      "price": 16.0
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Python Visualizers - Shape Rendering**

All three Python visualizers now:
- ✅ Read `shape` and `price` from JSON
- ✅ Draw different geometric shapes:
  - **Rectangles**: Filled rectangles (as before)
  - **Circles**: Actual circles inscribed in bounding box
  - **Triangles**: Right triangles in bounding box
- ✅ Display price on each item label
- ✅ Show total value per bin
- ✅ Use shape-based color coding

## Shape Representations

### Rectangle (Red #FF6B6B)
```
┌────────────┐
│            │
│  Item ID   │
│   $10.00   │
│            │
└────────────┘
```
- Can rotate (10×3 or 8×2)
- Displayed as filled rectangle
- Rotation changes dimensions in JSON

### Circle (Teal #4ECDC4)
```
     ●●●●●
   ●●     ●●
  ●●       ●●
 ●● Item ID ●●
 ●● $16.00  ●●
  ●●       ●●
   ●●     ●●
     ●●●●●
```
- Cannot rotate (5×5 bounding box)
- Displayed as filled circle

## Running the Complete System

### Step 1: Run the Java Optimizer

```bash
cd java-optimizer
mvn clean compile exec:java
```

**Output will show:**
```
=== INVENTORY BY SHAPE ===
  Rectangle: 10 items | 10×3 cm | Rotatable: Yes | $10.00 each | Total: $100.00
  Rectangle: 20 items | 8×2 cm | Rotatable: Yes | $7.50 each | Total: $150.00
  Circle: 5 items | 5×5 cm | Rotatable: No | $16.00 each | Total: $80.00
  Triangle: 100 items | 4×4 cm | Rotatable: No | $3.00 each | Total: $300.00

Generation 10: Best = 0.004513 | Worst = 0.003201 | Avg = 0.003845
...
Generation 100: Best = 0.006215 | Worst = 0.004102 | Avg = 0.005089

=== PACKING STATISTICS ===
Total Items: 135
Packed Items: 127
Unpacked Items: 8

=== VALUE STATISTICS ===
Total Value: $630.00
Packed Value: $606.00 (96.2%)
Unpacked Value: $24.00
Unpacked Area: 128 cm²
Wastage (Empty Space): 142 cm²

=== UNPACKED ITEMS BY SHAPE ===
  Triangle: 8 items ($3.00 each) = $24.00 total
```

### Step 2: Visualize with Python

## Rotation Handling

### How Rotation Works

1. **Java Optimizer:**
   - Tries original orientation first
   - If it doesn't fit, tries rotated (swap width/height)
   - Saves actual placed dimensions in JSON

2. **JSON Output:**
   ```json
   // Original: 10×3 Rectangle
   {"width": 10, "height": 3}  // Normal orientation
   
   // After rotation
   {"width": 3, "height": 10}  // Rotated 90°
   ```

3. **Python Visualizers:**
   - Read width/height from JSON
   - No need to guess rotation
   - Draw exactly as placed

### What Can Rotate?

| Shape | Can Rotate? | Why? |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Rectangle (10×3) | ✅ Yes | Non-square, benefits from rotation |
| Rectangle (8×2) | ✅ Yes | Non-square, benefits from rotation |
| Circle (5×5) | ❌ No | Square bounding box, no benefit |
| Triangle (4×4) | ❌ No | Square bounding box, no benefit |

## Visual Comparison

### Before (Old Version)
```
All items shown as rectangles
Color coded by item ID prefix (A, B, C, D)
No price information
Had to guess rotation from position
```

### After (New Version)
```
Shapes rendered accurately:
- Rectangles as rectangles
- Circles as circles
- Triangles as triangles

Price shown on each item
Total value per bin
Color coded by shape type
Rotation handled automatically via JSON
```

---

## Color Scheme

| Shape | Color | Hex Code | Visual |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| **Rectangle** | Red | `#FF6B6B` | 🟥 |
| **Circle** | Teal | `#4ECDC4` | 🟦 |
| **Triangle** | Green | `#96CEB4` | 🟩 |

This makes it easy to visually distinguish between shapes at a glance.

---

## Example Output Comparison

### Bin Display (Before)
```
Bin 1 - Items: 25 | Area: 800/1000 cm²
```

### Bin Display (After)
```
Bin 1 | 25 items | $245.50
Items: 25 | Area: 800/1000 cm² | Value: $245.50
```

Now you can see:
- **How many items** are packed
- **How much space** is used
- **How much value** is packed

## Technical Details

### Modified Files

#### Java Side
1. **`Item.java`** - Added `shape` field
2. **`BinSolution.java`** - Added `shape` and `price` to JSON output
3. **`FirstFitPlacer.java`** - Preserves shape through rotation
4. **`Main.java`** - Creates items with shape types

#### Python Side
1. **`visualizer.py`** - Added `draw_shape_patch()` function
2. **`executor_with_viz.py`** - Updated `LivePackingVisualizer` class
3. **`realtime_visualizer.py`** - Added shape rendering to animation

### New Drawing Functions

All visualizers now use a common `draw_shape_patch()` function:

```python
def draw_shape_patch(ax, shape, x, y, width, height, color, item_id, price):
    if shape == "Circle":
        # Draw circle inscribed in bounding box
        center_x = x + width / 2
        center_y = y + height / 2
        radius = min(width, height) / 2
        circle = patches.Circle((center_x, center_y), radius, ...)
        
    elif shape == "Triangle":
        # Draw right triangle
        triangle_points = [(x, y), (x + width, y), (x, y + height)]
        triangle = patches.Polygon(triangle_points, ...)
        
    else:  # Rectangle
        rect = patches.Rectangle((x, y), width, height, ...)
```

---

## Benefits of Shape-Based Visualization

✅ **Visual Clarity**: Instantly see what type of item it is  
✅ **Accurate Representation**: Shapes match real physical items  
✅ **Value Awareness**: See which items are valuable at a glance  
✅ **Better Understanding**: Circles and triangles are visually distinct  
✅ **Rotation Clarity**: No need to guess - dimensions come from JSON  
✅ **Economic Analysis**: Track value distribution across bins

---

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Shapes look distorted
**A:** Make sure matplotlib aspect ratio is set to 'equal':
```python
ax.set_aspect('equal')
```

### Q: Circles not appearing
**A:** Check that the JSON has the `shape` field. If missing, it defaults to Rectangle.

### Q: Prices showing as $0.00
**A:** Re-run the Java optimizer to regenerate JSON with price data.

### Q: Old visualization still shows rectangles only
**A:** Make sure you're using the updated visualizer files. Check that `draw_shape_patch()` exists.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run the optimizer** to generate new JSON with shape/price data
2. **Try all three visualizers** to see different views
3. **Compare results** across multiple runs
4. **Analyze** which shapes get left out (likely low-value triangles)

The system now provides a complete visual and economic picture of the bin packing optimization! 🎯
